ROS2 LiDAR Object Clustering — Progress Log

Completed Steps:

ROS2 Jazzy workspace created (ros2_ws)

Python package created: lidar_clustering_py

Dependencies added and configured:

rclpy

sensor_msgs

geometry_msgs

visualization_msgs

Workspace built successfully using colcon

Lexus LiDAR dataset (.mcap) verified using ros2 bag info

Bag file played using simulated clock and loop mode (--clock -l)

LiDAR topic verified:
/lexus3/os_center/points (sensor_msgs/PointCloud2)

TF frames verified and correct fixed frame identified:
lexus3/os_center_a_laser_data_frame

RViz2 issues resolved (OGRE library mismatch fixed)

Raw LiDAR PointCloud2 successfully visualized in RViz2

QoS mismatch resolved (Best Effort policy)

DBSCAN-based LiDAR clustering node implemented

Cluster centroids computed from point cloud data

Cluster centroids published as MarkerArray on /pc_clusters

Cluster visualization successfully displayed in RViz2

Screenshots of LiDAR clustering results added to GitHub repository

Current Status:

Real-time LiDAR point cloud visible and updating correctly in RViz2

DBSCAN clustering node running successfully

Cluster centroids visualized as 3D markers

Core project objectives achieved

Next Planned Enhancements:

Assign unique colors to each detected cluster

Add 3D bounding boxes around clusters

Tune DBSCAN parameters for different environments



Prepare final project report or presentation
