ROS2 LiDAR Object Clustering and Visualization — Progress Log

Project Goal:
To detect objects from LiDAR point cloud data by grouping nearby points into clusters and visualizing detected objects in RViz using ROS2.

Dataset Used:
lexus3-2024-04-05-gyor.mcap
Sensor: Ouster OS LiDAR
ROS2 Version: Jazzy

Current Functionality:

Raw LiDAR point cloud is received from ROS2 bag playback

PointCloud2 messages are processed in a Python ROS2 node

DBSCAN algorithm is used to group nearby points into clusters

Centroid of each cluster is calculated

Cluster centroids are published as MarkerArray messages

RViz displays both raw LiDAR points and detected cluster centers

Completed Steps:

ROS2 Jazzy workspace created (ros2_ws)

Python package created: lidar_clustering_py

Dependencies added:
rclpy
sensor_msgs
geometry_msgs
visualization_msgs

Workspace built successfully using colcon

Lexus LiDAR dataset verified using ros2 bag info

Bag file played using simulated clock and looping

LiDAR topic verified: /lexus3/os_center/points

TF frames verified and fixed frame identified:
lexus3/os_center_a_laser_data_frame

RViz2 OGRE library issue resolved

Raw LiDAR point cloud visualized in RViz2

QoS mismatch resolved using Best Effort policy

DBSCAN clustering node implemented

Cluster centroids published on /pc_clusters

Cluster visualization confirmed in RViz2

Screenshots added to GitHub repository

Current Status:

LiDAR data streaming correctly

Clustering node running without errors

Cluster centers visible in RViz

Core project goals achieved

Next Planned Improvements:

Add bounding boxes around detected clusters

Assign unique colors to different clusters

Move from bag playback to Gazebo LiDAR simulation

Add robot model with LiDAR sensor in simulation

Convert clustering node to C++ for better performance

Implement object tracking across frames
